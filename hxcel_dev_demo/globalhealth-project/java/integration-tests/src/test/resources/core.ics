SUMMARY:This Cat Roars! Experience the New Functionality in JavaTM 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SETM), Version 1.5
DESCRIPTION:Today JavaTM technology is everywhere -- in large enterprise systems, desktops, hand-held devices and smart cards. Consequently Java technology is the platform of choice for developers all over the world. All this has happened in the short time since the technology was first introduced in 1995. While there have been updates and enhancements since the first version, release 1.5 of the core Java platform brings to the table more language-level updates and other enhancements through the incorporation of a number of Java Specification Requests (JSRs) than at any other time. In this hands-on session, developers will learn about all these changes and how to build desktop applications using version 1.5 of the Java platform.

SUMMARY:Performance Measurement of Mixed JavaTM Technology, JIT-Compiled, and Native Applications
DESCRIPTION:Many JavaTM technology-based applications are not pure Java technology, but include JIT-compiled code, as well as native code, accessed through JNI. Performance measurement for such codes is very important, and not available with typical Java software tools. In this session we describe the implementation of an external profiling agent that profiles mixed-model Java language codes. We show how the user can collect data on such applications, and how the data can be used to analyze the application's performance.
