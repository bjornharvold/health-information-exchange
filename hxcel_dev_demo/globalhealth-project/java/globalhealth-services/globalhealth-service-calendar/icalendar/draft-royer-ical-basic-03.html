<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
	This is the second release of a iCalendar. After having learned
	from RFC-2445. This document represents the common objects
	needed for basic calendaring. The VTODO, VJOURNAL, VTIMEZONE,
        recurrence rules (RDATE remains), and scheduling and their
        associated properties have been removed. These removals are expected
        to appear in new memos at a later time and will be independent
        extensions of this specification. The new EXTENSIONS property will
        exist to allow for compatible sets of extensions.

</p>
<p>
        A very large part of this memo is text directly from RFC-2445.

</p>
<p>
	This memo is intented to be 100% compatible with RFC-2445. By
	limiting the objects to the ones used by most vendors this
	version has a better chance for interoperability and standardization.

</p>
<p>
   There is a clear need to provide and deploy interoperable calendaring
   and scheduling services for the Internet. Current group scheduling
   and Personal Information Management (PIM) products are being extended
   for use across the Internet, today, in proprietary ways. This memo
   has been defined to provide the definition of a common format for
   openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the
   Internet.

</p>
<p>
   This MIME media type provides a standard content type for capturing
   calendar event entry information. It also can be
   used to convey free/busy time information. The content type is
   suitable as a MIME message entity that can be transferred over MIME
   based email systems, using HTTP or some other Internet transport. In
   addition, the content type is useful as an object for interactions
   between desktop applications using the operating system clipboard,
   drag/drop or file systems capabilities.

</p>
<p>
   This memo is based on the earlier work of the vCalendar specification
   and RFC-2445, RFC-2446, RFC-2447, and CAP <a class="info" href="#CAP">[1]<span> (</span><span class="info">Royer, D., “Calendar Access Protocol (CAP),�? XXXXX&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>
   (an experimental protocol) for the exchange of personal
   calendaring and scheduling information.
   In order to avoid confusion with this referenced work, this memo is
   to be known as the iCalendar Basic (iCal-Basic) specification.

</p>
<p>
   This memo defines the format for specifying iCalendar object methods.
   An iCalendar object method is a set of usage constraints for the
   iCalendar object. For example, these methods might define scheduling
   messages that request an event be scheduled, reply to an event
   request, send a cancellation notice for an event, modify or replace
   the definition of an event, provide a counter proposal for an
   original event request, delegate an event request to another
   individual, request free or busy time, reply to a free or busy time
   request, or provide similar scheduling messages. The iCalendar Transport-indendent
   Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) defined in <a class="info" href="#ITIP">[3]<span> (</span><span class="info">Silverberg,
S., Mansour, S., Dawson, F., and R. Hopson, “iCalendar
Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) : Scheduling
Events, Busy Time, To-dos and Journal Entries,�? November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> is one such
   scheduling protocol.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p>
   While implementing iCalendar applications much has been learned.
   Among those lessions is the need to make a simpler version of
   iCalendar that includes the common features used by almost all vendors.
   This memo describes a 'Basic' version of iCalendar that does not
   include recurrence rules, to-do's, journals, or timezones. These
   removals may be added in separate memos at a later time. These
   simplifications are seen as a way for more vendors to produce
   objects that are compatible with each other and without having
   to support all of the features possible in RFC-2445. A new property
   called EXTENSIONS allows for those conforming to this specification
   to detect any optional features while existing RFC-2445 implementations
   should already ignore the unknown property. A few properties have
   been tagged as no longer needed, these are marked as 'deprecated' in
   the sections that follow (GEO for example). And other properties and
   components are tagged as not in iCal-Basic, these may be reintroduced
   in future memos (RRULE for example).

</p>
<p>
   The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the
   last decade. Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become
   dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this
   information technology. However, the longer term growth of
   calendaring and scheduling, is currently limited by the lack of
   Internet standards for the message content types that are central to
   these knowledgeware applications. This memo is intended to progress
   the level of interoperability possible between dissimilar calendaring
   and scheduling applications. This memo defines a MIME content type
   for exchanging electronic calendaring and scheduling information. The
   Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification, or
   iCalendar, allows for the capture and exchange of information
   normally stored within a calendaring and scheduling application; such
   as a Personal Information Manager (PIM) or a Group Scheduling
   product.

</p>
<p>
   The purpose of an iCalendar objects is for exchanging calendar
   information between applications. iCalendar objects were not designed
   to be a calendar store file storage format. This specification makes
   no assumptions or recommendations about how an application stores
   iCalendar objects it generates or receives for use in its own calendar
   store. iCalendar objects simply exist to transfer information about
   a calendar entry from one application to another. When an iCalendar object
   is stored outside of the applications calendar store, then it should
   be saved using the ".ics" file extension or transfered
   in a "text/calendar" MIME object. The MIME transfer of
   an iCalendar object is described in iTIP and CAP. The email transfer
   of an iCalendar object is described in iMIP and iTIP.

</p>
<p>
   The iCalendar format is suitable as an exchange format between
   applications or systems. The format is defined in terms of a MIME
   content type. This will enable the object to be exchanged using
   several transports, including but not limited to SMTP, HTTP, a file
   system, desktop interactive protocols such as the use of a memory-
   based clipboard or drag/drop interactions, point-to-point
   asynchronous communication, wired-network transport, or some form of

</p>
<p>
   unwired transport such as infrared might also be used.

</p>
<p>
   The memo also provides for the definition of iCalendar object methods
   that will map this content type to a set of messages for supporting
   calendaring and scheduling operations such as requesting, replying
   to, modifying, and canceling meetings or appointments. The iCalendar object methods can be used to define
   other calendaring and scheduling operations such a requesting for and
   replying with free/busy time data. Such a scheduling protocol is
   defined in the iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability
   Protocol (iTIP) defined in <a class="info" href="#ITIP">[3]<span> (</span><span class="info">Silverberg,
S., Mansour, S., Dawson, F., and R. Hopson, “iCalendar
Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) : Scheduling
Events, Busy Time, To-dos and Journal Entries,�? November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
   The memo also includes a formal grammar for the content type based on
   the Internet ABNF defined in <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.2234">[13]<span> (</span><span class="info">Crocker, D. and P. Overell, “Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF,�? November&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>. This ABNF is required for
   the implementation of parsers and to serve as the definitive
   reference when ambiguities or questions arise in interpreting the
   descriptive prose definition of the memo.

<p>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interoperated as described in

</p>
<p>
   This memo makes use of both a descriptive prose and a more formal
   notation for defining the calendaring and scheduling format.

</p>
<p>
   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.2234">[13]<span> (</span><span class="info">Crocker, D. and P. Overell, “Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF,�? November&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>.
   Readers intending on implementing this format defined in this memo
   should be familiar with this notation in order to properly interpret
   the specifications of this memo.

</p>
<p>
   All numeric and hexadecimal values used in this memo are given in
   decimal notation.

</p>
<p>
   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive. However,
   all other property values are case-sensitive, unless otherwise
   stated.

</p>
<p>
   The format for the iCalendar object is based on the syntax of the
   <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.2425">[15]<span> (</span><span class="info">Howes, T., Smith, M., and F. Dawson, “A MIME Content-Type for Directory Information,�? September&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> content type. While the iCalendar object is not a profile
   of the <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.2425">[15]<span> (</span><span class="info">Howes, T., Smith, M., and F. Dawson, “A MIME Content-Type for Directory Information,�? September&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> content type, it does reuse a number of the
   elements from the <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.2425">[15]<span> (</span><span class="info">Howes, T., Smith, M., and F. Dawson, “A MIME Content-Type for Directory Information,�? September&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> specification.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor3">2.1</a>&nbsp;Formatting Conventions</h4>

<p>
   The mechanisms defined in this memo are defined in prose. Many of the
   terms used to describe these have common usage that is different than
   the standards usage of this memo. In order to reference within this
   memo elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core object
   (this memo) or interoperability protocol <a class="info" href="#ITIP">[3]<span> (</span><span class="info">Silverberg,
S., Mansour, S., Dawson, F., and R. Hopson, “iCalendar
Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) : Scheduling
Events, Busy Time, To-dos and Journal Entries,�? November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> some formatting
   conventions have been used. Calendaring and scheduling roles are
   referred to in quoted-strings of text with the first character of
   each word in upper case. For example, "Organizer" refers to a role of
   a "Calendar User" within the scheduling protocol defined by <a class="info" href="#ITIP">[3]<span> (</span><span class="info">Silverberg,
S., Mansour, S., Dawson, F., and R. Hopson, “iCalendar
Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) : Scheduling
Events, Busy Time, To-dos and Journal Entries,�? November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.
   Calendar components defined by this memo are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text. All calendar components start
   with the letter "V". For example, "VEVENT" refers to the event
   calendar component.
   Scheduling methods defined by <a class="info" href="#ITIP">[3]<span> (</span><span class="info">Silverberg,
S., Mansour, S., Dawson, F., and R. Hopson, “iCalendar
Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) : Scheduling
Events, Busy Time, To-dos and Journal Entries,�? November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text. For example, "REQUEST" refers to
   the method for requesting a scheduling calendar component be created
   or modified, "REPLY" refers to the method a recipient of a request
   uses to update their status with the "Organizer" of the calendar
   component.

</p>
<p>
   The properties defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property". For example,
   "ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to convey
   the calendar address of a calendar user. Property parameters defined
   by this memo are referred to with lowercase, quoted-strings of text,
   followed by the word "parameter". For example, "value" parameter
   refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to override the
   default data type for a property value. Enumerated values defined by
   this memo are referred to with capitalized text, either alone or
   followed by the word "value". For example, the "CANCELED" value can
   be used with the "STATUS" property.

<p>
   In the rest of this document, descriptions of characters are of the
   form "character name (codepoint)", where "codepoint" is from the US-
   ASCII character set. The "character name" is the authoritative
   description; (codepoint) is a reference to that character in US-ASCII
   or US-ASCII compatible sets (for example the ISO-8859-x family, UTF-
   8, ISO-2022-xx, KOI8-R). If a non-US-ASCII compatible character set
   is used, appropriate code-point from that character set MUST be
   chosen instead. Use of non-US-ASCII-compatible character sets is NOT
   recommended.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor8">3.2</a>&nbsp;Parameters</h4>

<p>
   Required parameters: none

</p>
<p>
   Optional parameters: charset, method, component and optinfo

</p>
<p>
   The "charset" parameter is defined in <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.2046">[10]<span> (</span><span class="info">Freed, N. and N. Borenstein, “Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) - Part Two: Media Types,�? November&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> for other body
   parts. It is used to identify the default character set used within
   the body part.

</p>
<p>
   The "method" parameter is used to convey the iCalendar object method
   or transaction semantics for the calendaring and scheduling
   information. It also is an identifier for the restricted set of
   properties and values that the iCalendar object consists of. The
   parameter is to be used as a guide for applications interpreting the
   information contained within the body part. It SHOULD NOT be used to
   exclude or require particular pieces of information unless the
   identified method definition specifically calls for this behavior.
   Unless specifically forbidden by a particular method definition, a
   text/calendar content type can contain any set of properties
   permitted by the Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
   Specification. The "method" parameter MUST be the same value as that
   specified in the "METHOD" component property in the iCalendar object.
   If one is present, the other MUST also be present.

</p>
<p>
   The value for the "method" parameter is defined as follows:

</p><pre>        method  = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
        ; IANA registered iCalendar object method
</pre>

<p>
   The "component" parameter conveys the type of iCalendar calendar
   component within the body part. If the iCalendar object contains more
   than one calendar component type, then multiple component parameters
   MUST be specified.

</p>
<p>
   The value for the "component" parameter is defined as follows:

</p><pre>        component       = "VFREEBUSY"
                        / x-name / iana-token)
</pre>

<p>
   The "optinfo" parameter conveys optional information about the
   iCalendar object within the body part. This parameter can only
   specify semantics already specified by the iCalendar object and that
   can be otherwise determined by parsing the body part. In addition,
   the optional information specified by this parameter MUST be
   consistent with that information specified by the iCalendar object.
   For example, it can be used to convey the "Attendee" response status
   to a meeting request. The parameter value consists of a string value.

</p>
<p>
   The parameter can be specified multiple times.

</p>
<p>
   This parameter MAY only specify semantics already specified by the
   iCalendar object and that can be otherwise determined by parsing the
   body part.

</p>
<p>
   The value for the "optinfo" parameter is defined as follows:

</p><pre>        optinfo = infovalue / qinfovalue

        infovalue       = iana-token / x-name

        qinfovalue      = DQUOTE (infovalue) DQUOTE
</pre>

<p>
   Optional content header fields: Any header fields defined by [RFC
   2045].

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor10">3.4</a>&nbsp;Encoding Considerations</h4>

<p>
   This MIME content type can contain 8bit characters, so the use of
   quoted-printable or BASE64 MIME content-transfer-encodings might be
   necessary when iCalendar objects are transferred across protocols
   restricted to the 7bit repertoire. Note that a text valued property
   in the content entity can also have content encoding of special
   characters using a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92)
   escapement technique. This means that content values can end up
   encoded twice.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.5"></a><h4><a name="anchor11">3.5</a>&nbsp;Security Considerations</h4>

<p>
   SPOOFING - - In this memo, the "Organizer" is the only person
   authorized to make changes to an existing "VEVENT" calendar component and redistribute the updates to the
   "Attendees". An iCalendar object that maliciously changes or cancels
   an existing "VEVENT" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar
   component might be constructed by someone other than the "Organizer"
   and sent to the "Attendees". In addition in this memo, other than the
   "Organizer", an "Attendee" of a "VEVENT"
   calendar component is the only other person authorized to update any
   parameter associated with their "ATTENDEE" property and send it to
   the "Organizer". An iCalendar object that maliciously changes the
   "ATTENDEE" parameters can be constructed by someone other than the
   real "Attendee" and sent to the "Organizer".

</p>
<p>
   PROCEDURAL ALARMS - - An iCalendar object can be created that
   contains a "VEVENT" calendar component with "VALARM"
   calendar components. The "VALARM" calendar component can be of type
   PROCEDURE and can have an attachment containing some sort of
   executable program. Implementations that incorporate these types of
   alarms are subject to any virus or malicious attack that might occur
   as a result of executing the attachment.

</p>
<p>
   ATTACHMENTS - - An iCalendar object can include references to Uniform
   Resource Locators that can be programmed resources.

</p>
<p>
   Implementers and users of this memo should be aware of the network
   security implications of accepting and parsing such information. In
   addition, the security considerations observed by implementations of
   electronic mail systems should be followed for this memo.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;iCalendar Object Specification</h3>

<p>
   The following sections define the details of a Calendaring and
   Scheduling Core Object Specification. This information is intended to
   be an integral part of the MIME content type registration. In
   addition, this information can be used independent of such content
   registration. In particular, this memo has direct applicability for
   use as a calendaring and scheduling exchange format in file-, memory-
   or network-based transport mechanisms.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor20">4.1</a>&nbsp;Content Lines</h4>

<p>
   The iCalendar object is organized into individual lines of text,
   called content lines. Content lines are delimited by a line break,
   which is a CRLF sequence (US-ASCII decimal 13, followed by US-ASCII
   decimal 10).

</p>
<p>
   Lines of text SHOULD NOT be longer than 75 octets, excluding the line
   break. Long content lines SHOULD be split into a multiple line
   representations using a line "folding" technique. That is, a long
   line can be split between any two characters by inserting a CRLF
   immediately followed by a single linear white space character (i.e.,
   SPACE, US-ASCII decimal 32 or HTAB, US-ASCII decimal 9). Any sequence
   of CRLF followed immediately by a single linear white space character
   is ignored (i.e., removed) when processing the content type.

</p>
<p>
   For example the line:
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.

</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>
   Can be represented as:

</p><pre>     DESCRIPTION:This is a lo
      ng description
       that exists on a long line.

<p>
   The process of moving from this folded multiple line representation
   to its single line representation is called "unfolding". Unfolding is
   accomplished by removing the CRLF character and the linear white
   space character that immediately follows.

</p>
<p>
   When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first be unfolded
   according to the unfolding procedure described above. When generating
   a content line, lines longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded
   according to the folding procedure described above.

</p>
<p>
   The content information associated with an iCalendar object is
   formatted using a syntax similar to that defined by <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.2425">[15]<span> (</span><span class="info">Howes, T., Smith, M., and F. Dawson, “A MIME Content-Type for Directory Information,�? September&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>. That
   is, the content information consists of CRLF-separated content lines.

</p>
<p>
   The following notation defines the lines of content in an iCalendar
   object:

</p><pre>     contentline        = name *(";" param ) ":" value CRLF
        ; This ABNF is just a general definition for an initial parsing
        ; of the content line into its property name, parameter list,
        ; and value string

     ; When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first

   The property value component of a content line has a format that is
   property specific. Refer to the section describing each property for
   a definition of this format.

</p>

   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive. However,

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor21">4.1.1</a>&nbsp;List and Field Separators</h4>

<p>
   Some properties and parameters allow a list of values. Values in a
   list of values MUST be separated by a COMMA character (US-ASCII
   decimal 44). There is no significance to the order of values in a
   list. For those parameter values (such as those that specify URI
   values) that are specified in quoted-strings, the individual quoted-
   strings are separated by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).

</p>
<p>
   Some property values are defined in terms of multiple parts. These
   structured property values MUST have their value parts separated by a
   SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

</p>
<p>
   Some properties allow a list of parameters. Each property parameter
   in a list of property parameters MUST be separated by a SEMICOLON
   character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

</p>
<p>
   Property parameters with values containing a COLON, a SEMICOLON or a
   COMMA character MUST be placed in quoted text.

</p>
<p>
   For example, in the following properties a SEMICOLON is used to
   separate property parameters from each other, and a COMMA is used to
   separate property values in a value list.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor22">4.1.2</a>&nbsp;Multiple Values</h4>

<p>
   Some properties defined in the iCalendar object can have multiple
   values. The general rule for encoding multi-valued items is to simply
   create a new content line for each value, including the property
   name. However, it should be noted that some properties support
   encoding multiple values in a single property by separating the
   values with a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44). Individual
   property definitions should be consulted for determining whether a
   specific property allows multiple values and in which of these two
   forms.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.1.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor23">4.1.3</a>&nbsp;Binary Content</h4>

<p>
   Binary content information in an iCalendar object SHOULD be
   referenced using a URI within a property value. That is the binary
   content information SHOULD be placed in an external MIME entity that
   can be referenced by a URI from within the iCalendar object. In
   applications where this is not feasible, binary content information

</p>
<p>
   can be included within an iCalendar object, but only after first
   encoding it into text using the "BASE64" encoding method defined in
   <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.2045">[9]<span> (</span><span class="info">Freed,
N. and N. Borenstein, “Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) -
Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies,�? November&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a>. Inline binary contact SHOULD only be used in applications
   whose special circumstances demand that an iCalendar object be
   expressed as a single entity. A property containing inline binary
   content information MUST specify the "ENCODING" property parameter.
   Binary content information placed external to the iCalendar object
   MUST be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (URI).

</p>
<p>
   The following example specifies an "ATTACH" property that references
   an attachment external to the iCalendar object with a URI reference:

</p><pre>     ATTACH:http://xyz.com/public/quarterly-report.doc
</pre>

<p>
   The following example specifies an "ATTACH" property with inline
   binary encoded content information:

</p><pre>     ATTACH;FMTTYPE=image/basic;ENCODING=BASE64;VALUE=BINARY:
      MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAgICBEUwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEEBQAwdzELMAkGA1U

<a name="rfc.section.4.1.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor24">4.1.4</a>&nbsp;Character Set</h4>

<p>
   There is not a property parameter to declare the character set used
   in a property value. The default character set for an iCalendar
   object is UTF-8 as defined in <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.2279">[14]<span> (</span><span class="info">Yergeau, F., “UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646,�? January&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>.

</p>
<p>
   The "charset" Content-Type parameter can be used in MIME transports
   to specify any other IANA registered character set.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor25">4.2</a>&nbsp;Property Parameters</h4>

<p>
   A property can have attributes associated with it. These "property
   parameters" contain meta-information about the property or the
   property value. Property parameters are provided to specify such
   information as the location of an alternate text representation for a
   property value, the language of a text property value, the data type
   of the property value and other attributes.

</p>
<p>
   Property parameter values that contain the COLON (US-ASCII decimal
   58), SEMICOLON (US-ASCII decimal 59) or COMMA (US-ASCII decimal 44)
   character separators MUST be specified as quoted-string text values.
   Property parameter values MUST NOT contain the DOUBLE-QUOTE (US-ASCII
   decimal 22) character. The DOUBLE-QUOTE (US-ASCII decimal 22)
   character is used as a delimiter for parameter values that contain
   restricted characters or URI text. For example:

</p><pre>     DESCRIPTION;ALTREP="http://www.wiz.org":The Fall'98 Wild Wizards

   Format Definition: The "VALUE" property parameter is defined by the
   following notation:

</p><pre>     valuetypeparam = "VALUE" "=" valuetype

     valuetype  = ("BINARY"

                ; Some other IANA registered iCalendar data type.
</pre>

<p>
   Description: The parameter specifies the data type and format of the
   property value. The property values MUST be of a single value type.
   For example, a "RDATE" property cannot have a combination of DATE-
   TIME and TIME value types.

</p>
<p>
   If the property's value is the default value type, then this
   parameter need not be specified. However, if the property's default
   value type is overridden by some other allowable value type, then
   this parameter MUST be specified.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor44">4.3</a>&nbsp;Property Value Data Types</h4>

<p>
   The properties in an iCalendar object are strongly typed. The
   definition of each property restricts the value to be one of the
   value data types, or simply value types, defined in this section. The
   value type for a property will either be specified implicitly as the
   default value type or will be explicitly specified with the "VALUE"
   parameter. If the value type of a property is one of the alternate
   valid types, then it MUST be explicitly specified with the "VALUE"
   parameter.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.3.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor45">4.3.1</a>&nbsp;Binary</h4>

<p>
   Value Name: BINARY

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   a character encoding of inline binary data. For example, an inline
   attachment of an object code might be included in an iCalendar
   object.

</p>
<p>
   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

</p><pre>     binary     = *(4b-char) [b-end]
     ; A "BASE64" encoded character string, as defined by [RFC.2045].

     b-end      = (2b-char "==") / (3b-char "=")

     b-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/"
</pre>

<p>
   Description: Property values with this value type MUST also include
   the inline encoding parameter sequence of ";ENCODING=BASE64". That
   is, all inline binary data MUST first be character encoded using the
   "BASE64" encoding method defined in <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.2045">[9]<span> (</span><span class="info">Freed,

   Value Name: BOOLEAN

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   either a "TRUE" or "FALSE" Boolean value.

</p>
<p>
   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

</p><pre>     boolean    = "TRUE" / "FALSE"
</pre>

<p>
   Description: These values are case insensitive text. No additional
   content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character encoding) is
   defined for this value type.

</p>
<p>
   Formal Definition: The value type is as defined by the following
   notation:

</p><pre>     cal-address        = uri

<p>
   Value Name: DATE

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that contain a
   calendar date.

</p>
<p>
   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

</p><pre>     date               = date-value

     date-value         = date-fullyear date-month date-mday
     date-fullyear      = 4DIGIT

     date-month         = 2DIGIT        ;01-12
     date-mday          = 2DIGIT        ;01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31
                                        ;based on month/year
</pre>

<p>
   Description: If the property permits, multiple "date" values are
   specified as a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. The format for the value type is expressed as the [ISO
   8601] complete representation, basic format for a calendar date. The
   textual format specifies a four-digit year, two-digit month, and
   two-digit day of the month. There are no separator characters between
   the year, month and day component text.

</p>
<p>
   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) is defined for this value type.

</p>
<p>
   Example: The following represents July 14, 1997:

</p><pre>     19970714

<a name="rfc.section.4.3.5"></a><h4><a name="anchor49">4.3.5</a>&nbsp;Date-Time</h4>

<p>
   Value Name: DATE-TIME

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that specify a
   precise calendar date and time of day.

</p>
<p>
   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

</p><pre>     date-time  = date "T" time ;As specified in the date and time
                                ;value definitions
</pre>

<p>
   Description: If the property permits, multiple "date-time" values are
   specified as a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH
   character encoding) is defined for this value type.

</p>
<p>
   The "DATE-TIME" data type is used to identify values that contain a
   precise calendar date and time of day. The format is based on the
   <a class="info" href="#_XREF_ISO.8601">[4]<span> (</span><span class="info">,
“ISO 8601, Data elements and interchange formats-Information
interchange--Representation of dates and times International
Organization for Standardization,�? June&nbsp;1988.</span><span>)</span></a> complete representation, basic format for a calendar date
   and time of day. The text format is a concatenation of the "date",
   followed by the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character (US-ASCII decimal
   84) time designator, followed by the "time" format.

</p>
<p>
   The "DATE-TIME" data type expresses time values in three forms:

</p>
<p>
   The form of date and time with UTC offset MUST NOT be used. For
   example, the following is not valid for a date-time value:

</p><pre>     DTSTART:19980119T230000-0800       ;Invalid time format

   FORM #1: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME
</pre>

<p>
   The date with local time form is simply a date-time value that does
   not contain the UTC designator nor does it reference a time zone. For
   example, the following represents Janurary 18, 1998, at 11 PM:

</p><pre>     DTSTART:19980118T230000
</pre>

<p>
   Date-time values of this type are said to be "floating" and are not
   bound to any time zone in particular. They are used to represent the
   same hour, minute, and second value regardless of which time zone is
   currently being observed. For example, an event can be defined that
   indicates that an individual will be busy from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM
   every day, no matter which time zone the person is in. In these
   cases, a local time can be specified. The recipient of an iCalendar
   object with a property value consisting of a local time, without any
   relative time zone information, SHOULD interpret the value as being
   fixed to whatever time zone the ATTENDEE is in at any given moment.
   This means that two ATTENDEEs, in different time zones, receiving the
   same event definition as a floating time, may be participating in the
   event at different actual times. Floating time SHOULD only be used
   where that is the reasonable behavior.

</p>
<p>
   In most cases, a fixed time is desired. To properly communicate a
   fixed time in a property value, UTC time must be specified.
   Time zones are not in iCal-Basic and may be added in a future
   extension.

</p>
<p>
   FORM #2: DATE WITH UTC TIME

</p>
<p>
   The date with UTC time, or absolute time, is identified by a LATIN
   CAPITAL LETTER Z suffix character (US-ASCII decimal 90), the UTC
   designator, appended to the time value. For example, the following
   represents January 19, 1998, at 0700 UTC:

</p><pre>
     DTSTART:19980119T070000Z
</pre>

<p>
   FORM #3: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME AND TIME ZONE REFERENCE

</p>
<p>
   Are not supported or needed in iCal-Basic implementations. Time
   zone information is needed only when including recurring rules (the
   RFC-2445 RRULE and EXRULE) and they may be added at a later time.

</p>
<p>
   Example: The following represents July 14, 1997, at 1:30 PM in New
   York City in each of the two time formats, using the "DTSTART"
   property.

</p><pre>     DTSTART:19970714T133000            ;Local time
     DTSTART:19970714T173000Z           ;UTC time
</pre>

<p>
   A time value MUST ONLY specify 60 seconds when specifying the
   periodic "leap second" in the time value. For example:

</p><pre>     COMPLETED:19970630T235960Z
</pre>

<a name="rfc.section.4.3.6"></a><h4><a name="anchor50">4.3.6</a>&nbsp;Duration</h4>

<p>
   Value Name: DURATION

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   a duration of time.

</p>
<p>
   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

</p><pre>     dur-value  = (["+"] / "-") "P" (dur-date / dur-time / dur-week)

     dur-date    = dur-day [dur-time]
     dur-time    = "T" (dur-of-time)
     dur-week    = 1*DIGIT "W"
     dur-of-time = 1*DIGIT "H" dur-minute
     dur-minute  = 1*DIGIT "M" dur-second
     dur-second  = 1*DIGIT "S"
     dur-day     = 1*DIGIT "D"
</pre>

<p>
   Description: If the property permits, multiple "duration" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. The format is expressed as the <a class="info" href="#_XREF_ISO.8601">[4]<span> (</span><span class="info">,
“ISO 8601, Data elements and interchange formats-Information
interchange--Representation of dates and times International
Organization for Standardization,�? June&nbsp;1988.</span><span>)</span></a> basic format for
   the duration of time. The format can represent durations in terms of
   weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

</p>
<p>
   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) are defined for this value type.

</p>
<p>
One week (1W) is defined to mean seven days (7D).

</p>
<p>
One day (1D) is defined to mean add one to the date part. If is what
you really need is 24 hours, use "24H" and not "1D". This matters when
one or more instances have their start or end time across a time zone
change within one single time zone (Wall clock has 1 hour added to it
or subtracted from it when the time zone changes). And the time
part is not effected. So "1D" added to a date part when the time
zone changes could mean that the appointment is 23 hours long or
25 hours long, depending on how the time zone changes. In all
cases, add to the 'date' part and not to the 'time' part for 'dur-day'
duration parts.

</p>
<p>
One hour (1H) is defined to mean 60 minutes (60M).

</p>
<p>
One minute (1M) is defined to mean 60 seconds (60S).
If an implementation cares about that leap second, then send the
time in seconds (Example: Send "61S" or "1M1S" and not "1M"). 

</p>
<p>
The 'dur-hour', 'dur-minute', 'dur-minute', and 'dur-day' property
value parts do not need to be normalized. Example: One implementation
may send "3600S" and another "1H" and they are equivelent.
The value part "1D" is not always equivelent to "24H".

</p>
<p>
The order of addition is 'W', 'D', 'H', 'M', then 'S'. In that order.

</p>
<p>
Note that some existing calendaring implementations include the 'dur-time' parts
that are zero and others do not. For example one implementation
might send a value of "+PT30S" and another implementation might send "+PT0H0M30S".
The ABNF above shows that the abbreivated format is deprecated.
The new 'dur-of-time' always includes the 'H', 'M', and 'S'
parts even when they are zero. This is done so that there
is exactly one way to send the time part of a duration.

</p>
<p>
   Example: A duration of 15 days, 5 hours and 20 seconds would be:

</p><pre>     P15DT5H0M20S
</pre>

<p>
   A duration of 7 weeks would be:

</p><pre>     P7W
</pre>
<pre>Given
    DTSTART:20050401T235959
    DURATATION:+P1DT0H0M1S

    Add 1D gives:

     End time of: 20050402T235959

    Then add 1S should result in.

     End time of: 20050403T000000

Given:

   DTSTART:20050401T235959
   DURATION:+P1W

   Add 1W gives:

<a name="rfc.section.4.3.8"></a><h4><a name="anchor52">4.3.8</a>&nbsp;Integer</h4>

<p>
     Value Name:INTEGER

</p>
<p>
     Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
     a signed integer value.

</p>
<p>
     Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
     notation:

</p><pre>     integer    = (["+"] / "-") 1*DIGIT
</pre>

<p>
     Description: If the property permits, multiple "integer" values are
     specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
     of values. The valid range for "integer" is -2147483648 to
     2147483647. If the sign is not specified, then the value is assumed
     to be positive.

</p>
<p>
     No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
     encoding) is defined for this value type.

</p>
<p>
     Example:

</p><pre>     1234567890
     -1234567890

<a name="rfc.section.4.3.9"></a><h4><a name="PeriodOfTime">4.3.9</a>&nbsp;Period of Time</h4>

<p>
   Value Name: PERIOD

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that contain a
   precise period of time.

</p>
<p>
   Formal Definition: The data type is defined by the following
   notation:

</p><pre>     period     = period-explicit / period-start

     period-explicit = date-time "/" date-time
     ; [ISO.8601] complete representation basic format for a period of
     ; time consisting of a start and end. The start MUST be before the
     ; end.

     period-start = date-time "/" dur-value
     ; [ISO.8601] complete representation basic format for a period of
     ; time consisting of a start and positive duration of time.
</pre>

<p>
   Description: If the property permits, multiple "period" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. There are two forms of a period of time. First, a period
   of time is identified by its start and its end. This format is
   expressed as the <a class="info" href="#_XREF_ISO.8601">[4]<span> (</span><span class="info">,
“ISO 8601, Data elements and interchange formats-Information
interchange--Representation of dates and times International
Organization for Standardization,�? June&nbsp;1988.</span><span>)</span></a> complete representation, basic format for
   "DATE-TIME" start of the period, followed by a SOLIDUS character
   (US-ASCII decimal 47), followed by the "DATE-TIME" of the end of the
   period. The start of the period MUST be before the end of the period.
   Second, a period of time can also be defined by a start and a
   positive duration of time. The format is expressed as the <a class="info" href="#_XREF_ISO.8601">[4]<span> (</span><span class="info">,
“ISO 8601, Data elements and interchange formats-Information
interchange--Representation of dates and times International
Organization for Standardization,�? June&nbsp;1988.</span><span>)</span></a>
   complete representation, basic format for the "DATE-TIME" start of
   the period, followed by a SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII decimal 47),
   followed by the <a class="info" href="#_XREF_ISO.8601">[4]<span> (</span><span class="info">,
“ISO 8601, Data elements and interchange formats-Information
interchange--Representation of dates and times International
Organization for Standardization,�? June&nbsp;1988.</span><span>)</span></a> basic format for "DURATION" of the period.

</p>
<p>
   Example: The period starting at 18:00:00 UTC, on January 1, 1997 and
   ending at 07:00:00 UTC on January 2, 1997 would be:

</p><pre>     19970101T180000Z/19970102T070000Z
</pre>

<p>
   The period start at 18:00:00 on January 1, 1997 and lasting 5 hours
   and 30 minutes would be:

</p><pre>     19970101T180000Z/PT5H30M

</p>
<p>
   Description: If the property permits, multiple "text" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values.

</p>
<p>
   The language in which the text is represented can be controlled by
   the "LANGUAGE" property parameter.

</p>
<p>
   An intentional formatted text line break MUST only be included in a
   "TEXT" property value by representing the line break with the
   character sequence of BACKSLASH (US-ASCII decimal 92), followed by a
   LATIN SMALL LETTER N (US-ASCII decimal 110) or a LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
   N (US-ASCII decimal 78), that is "\n" or "\N".

</p>
<p>
   The "TEXT" property values may also contain special characters that
   are used to signify delimiters, such as a COMMA character for lists
   of values or a SEMICOLON character for structured values. In order to
   support the inclusion of these special characters in "TEXT" property
   values, they MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character. A BACKSLASH
   character (US-ASCII decimal 92) in a "TEXT" property value MUST be
   escaped with another BACKSLASH character. A COMMA character in a
   "TEXT" property value MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character
   (US-ASCII decimal 92). A SEMICOLON character in a "TEXT" property
   value MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal
   92).  However, a COLON character in a "TEXT" property value SHALL NOT
   be escaped with a BACKSLASH character.Example: A multiple line value
   of:

</p><pre>     Project XYZ Final Review
     Conference Room - 3B
     Come Prepared.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3.12"></a><h4><a name="anchor55">4.3.12</a>&nbsp;Time</h4>

<p>
   Value Name: TIME

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that contain a
   time of day.

</p>
<p>
   Formal Definition: The data type is defined by the following
   notation:

</p><pre>     time               = time-hour time-minute time-second [time-utc]

     time-hour          = 2DIGIT        ;00-23
     time-minute        = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
     time-second        = 2DIGIT        ;00-60
     ;The "60" value is used to account for "leap" seconds.

     time-utc   = "Z"
</pre>

<p>
   Description: If the property permits, multiple "time" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH
   character encoding) is defined for this value type.

</p>
<p>
   The "TIME" data type is used to identify values that contain a time
   of day. The format is based on the <a class="info" href="#_XREF_ISO.8601">[4]<span> (</span><span class="info">,
“ISO 8601, Data elements and interchange formats-Information
interchange--Representation of dates and times International
Organization for Standardization,�? June&nbsp;1988.</span><span>)</span></a> complete
   representation, basic format for a time of day. The text format
   consists of a two-digit 24-hour of the day (i.e., values 0-23), two-
   digit minute in the hour (i.e., values 0-59), and two-digit seconds
   in the minute (i.e., values 0-60). The seconds value of 60 MUST only
   to be used to account for "leap" seconds. Fractions of a second are
   not supported by this format.

</p>
<p>
   In parallel to the "DATE-TIME" definition above, the "TIME" data type
   expresses time values in three forms:

</p>
<p>
   The form of time with UTC offset MUST NOT be used. For example, the
   following is NOT VALID for a time value:

</p><pre>     230000-0800        ;Invalid time format
</pre>

<p>
   FORM #1 LOCAL TIME

</p>
<p>
   The local time form is simply a time value that does not contain the
   UTC designator nor does it reference a time zone. For example, 11:00
   PM:

</p><pre>     230000
</pre>

<p>
   Time values of this type are said to be "floating" and are not bound
   to any time zone in particular. They are used to represent the same
   hour, minute, and second value regardless of which time zone is
   currently being observed. For example, an event can be defined that
   indicates that an individual will be busy from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM
   every day, no matter which time zone the person is in. In these
   cases, a local time can be specified. The recipient of an iCalendar
   object with a property value consisting of a local time, without any
   relative time zone information, SHOULD interpret the value as being
   fixed to whatever time zone the ATTENDEE is in at any given moment.
   This means that two ATTENDEEs may participate in the same event at
   different UTC times; floating time SHOULD only be used where that is
   reasonable behavior.

</p>
<p>
   In most cases, a fixed time is desired. To properly communicate a
   fixed time in a property value, UTC time MUST be specified.
   Time zones are not in iCal-Basic and may be added in a future
   extension.

</p>
<p>
   FORM #2: UTC TIME

</p>
<p>
   UTC time, or absolute time, is identified by a LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z
   suffix character (US-ASCII decimal 90), the UTC designator, appended
   to the time value. For example, the following represents 07:00 AM
   UTC:

</p><pre>     070000Z
</pre>

<p>
   FORM #3: LOCAL TIME AND TIME ZONE REFERENCE

</p>
<p>

</p><p>
   Are not supported or needed in iCal-Basic implementations. Time
   zone information is needed only when including recurring rules
   and they may be added at a later time.

</p>


<p>
   Example: The following represents 8:30 AM in New York in Winter, five
   hours behind UTC, in each of the two formats using the "X-
   TIMEOFDAY" non-standard property:

</p><pre>     X-TIMEOFDAY:083000

<p>
   Value Name: URI

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that contain a
   uniform resource identifier (URI) type of reference to the property
   value.

</p>
<p>
   Formal Definition: The data type is defined by the following
   notation:

</p><pre>     uri        = &lt;As defined by any IETF RFC&gt;
</pre>

<p>
   Description: This data type might be used to reference binary
   information, for values that are large, or otherwise undesirable to
   include directly in the iCalendar object.

</p>
<p>
   The URI value formats in RFC 1738, RFC 2111 and any other IETF
   registered value format can be specified.

</p>
<p>
   Any IANA registered URI format can be used. These include, but are
   not limited to, those defined in RFC 1738 and RFC 2111.

</p>
<p>
   When a property parameter value is a URI value type, the URI MUST be
   specified as a quoted-string value.

</p>
<p>
   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) is defined for this value type.

</p>
<p>
   Example: The following is a URI for a network file:

<a name="rfc.section.4.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor58">4.4</a>&nbsp;iCalendar Object</h4>

<p>
   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object is a collection of
   calendaring and scheduling information. Typically, this information
   will consist of a single iCalendar object. However, multiple
   iCalendar objects can be sequentially grouped together. The first
   line and last line of the iCalendar object MUST contain a pair of
   iCalendar object delimiter strings. The syntax for an iCalendar
   object is as follows:

</p><pre>     icalobject = 1*("BEGIN" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF
                  icalbody
                  "END" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF)
</pre>

<p>
   The following is a simple example of an iCalendar object:

</p><pre>     BEGIN:VCALENDAR
     VERSION:2.0
     PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN
     BEGIN:VEVENT

<a name="rfc.section.4.5"></a><h4><a name="anchor59">4.5</a>&nbsp;Property</h4>

<p>
   A property is the definition of an individual attribute describing a
   calendar or a calendar component. A property takes the form defined
   by the "contentline" notation defined in section 4.1.1.

</p>
<p>
   The following is an example of a property:

</p><pre>     DTSTART:19960415T133000Z
</pre>

<p>
   This memo imposes no ordering of properties within an iCalendar
   object.

</p>
<p>
   Property names, parameter names and enumerated parameter values are
   case insensitive. For example, the property name "DUE" is the same as
   "due" and "Due", DTSTART:19980714T120000 is the same
   as DtStart:19980714T120000.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.6"></a><h4><a name="anchor60">4.6</a>&nbsp;Calendar Components</h4>

<p>
   The body of the iCalendar object consists of a sequence of calendar
   properties and one or more calendar components. The calendar
   properties are attributes that apply to the calendar as a whole. The
   calendar components are collections of properties that express a
   particular calendar semantic. For example, the calendar component can
   specify an event entry, free/busy time information, or an alarm.

</p>
<p>
   The body of the iCalendar object is defined by the following
   notation:

</p><pre>     icalbody   = calprops component

     calprops   = 2*(

                ; 'prodid' and 'version' are both REQUIRED,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                prodid /version /

                ; 'calscale' and 'method' are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                calscale        /
                method          /

                x-prop

                )

     component  = 1*(eventc / freebusyc /
                / timezonec / iana-comp / x-comp)

     iana-comp  = "BEGIN" ":" iana-token CRLF

                  1*contentline

                  "END" ":" iana-token CRLF

     x-comp     = "BEGIN" ":" x-name CRLF

                  1*contentline

                  "END" ":" x-name CRLF
</pre>

<p>
   An iCalendar object MUST include the "PRODID" and "VERSION" calendar
   properties. In addition, it MUST include at least one calendar
   component. Special forms of iCalendar objects are possible to publish
   just busy time (i.e., only a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component) information. In
   addition, a complex iCalendar object is possible that is used to
   capture a complete snapshot of the contents of a calendar (e.g.,
   composite of many different calendar components). More commonly, an
   iCalendar object will consist of just a single "VEVENT"
   calendar component.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.6.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor61">4.6.1</a>&nbsp;Event Component</h4>

<p>
   Component Name: "VEVENT"

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: Provide a grouping of component properties that describe an
   event.

</p>
<p>
   Format Definition: A "VEVENT" calendar component is defined by the
   following notation:

</p><pre>     eventc     = "BEGIN" ":" "VEVENT" CRLF
                  eventprop *alarmc

                resources / x-prop / rdate

                )
</pre>

<p>
   Description: A "VEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of component
   properties, and possibly including "VALARM" calendar components, that
   represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar. For example, it
   can be an activity; such as a one-hour long, department meeting from
   8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow. Generally, an event will take up time
   on an individual calendar. Hence, the event will appear as an opaque
   interval in a search for busy time. Alternately, the event can have
   its Time Transparency set to "TRANSPARENT" in order to prevent
   blocking of the event in searches for busy time.

</p>
<p>
   The "VEVENT" is also the calendar component used to specify an
   anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar. These events have a
   DATE value type for the "DTSTART" property instead of the default
   data type of DATE-TIME. The anniversary type of
   "VEVENT" can span more than one date (i.e, "DURATION" property value is
   set to a value that is more than 24 hours).

</p>
<p>
   The "DTSTART" property for a "VEVENT" specifies the inclusive start
   of the event. The "DURATION" property for a "VEVENT"
   calendar component specifies the non-inclusive end of the event. For
   cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component specifies a "DTSTART"
   property with a DATE data type but no "DURATION" property, the events
   non-inclusive end is the end of the calendar date specified by the
   "DTSTART" property. For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component
   specifies a "DTSTART" property with a DATE-TIME data type but no
   "DURATION" property, the event ends on the same calendar date and time
   of day specified by the "DTSTART" property (It consumes no time).

</p>
<p>
   The "VEVENT" calendar component cannot be nested within another
   calendar component.

</p>
<p>
   Example: The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar
   component used to represent a meeting that will also be opaque to
   searches for busy time:

</p><pre>     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123401@host.com
     DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
     DTSTART:19970903T163000Z
     DURATION:PT3H30M
     SUMMARY:Annual Employee Review
     CLASS:PRIVATE
     CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
     END:VEVENT
</pre>

<p>
   The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component used
   to represent a reminder that will not be opaque, but rather
   transparent, to searches for busy time:

</p><pre>     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123402@host.com
     DTSTAMP:19970901T1300Z
     DTSTART:19970401T163000Z
     DURATION:PT7H30M
     SUMMARY:Laurel is in sensitivity awareness class.
     CLASS:PUBLIC
     CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
     TRANSP:TRANSPARENT
     END:VEVENT
</pre>

<p>
   The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component used
   to represent an anniversary that will occur once. Since it takes
   up no time, it will not appear as opaque in a search for busy time;
   no matter what the value of the "TRANSP" property indicates:

</p><pre>     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123403@host.com

   Description: A "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is a grouping of
   component properties that represents either a request for, a reply to
   a request for free or busy time information or a published set of
   busy time information.

</p>
<p>
   When used to request free/busy time information, the "ATTENDEE"
   property specifies the calendar users whose free/busy time is being
   requested; the "ORGANIZER" property specifies the calendar user who
   is requesting the free/busy time; the "DTSTART" and "DURATION"
   properties specify the window of time for which the free/busy time is
   being requested; the "UID" and "DTSTAMP" properties are specified to
   assist in proper sequencing of multiple free/busy time requests.

</p>
<p>
   When used to reply to a request for free/busy time, the "ATTENDEE"
   property specifies the calendar user responding to the free/busy time
   request; the "ORGANIZER" property specifies the calendar user that
   originally requested the free/busy time; the "FREEBUSY" property
   specifies the free/busy time information (if it exists); and the

</p>
<p>
   "UID" and "DTSTAMP" properties are specified to assist in proper
   sequencing of multiple free/busy time replies.

</p>
<p>
   When used to publish busy time, the "ORGANIZER" property specifies
   the calendar user associated with the published busy time; the
   "DTSTART" and "DURATION" properties specify an inclusive time window
   that surrounds the busy time information; the "FREEBUSY" property
   specifies the published busy time information; and the "DTSTAMP"
   property specifies the date/time that iCalendar object was created.

</p>
<p>
   The "VFREEBUSY" calendar component cannot be nested within another
   calendar component. Multiple "VFREEBUSY" calendar components can be
   specified within an iCalendar object. This permits the grouping of
   Free/Busy information into logical collections, such as monthly
   groups of busy time information.

</p>
<p>
   The "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is intended for use in iCalendar
   object methods involving requests for free time, requests for busy
   time, requests for both free and busy, and the associated replies.

</p>
<p>
   Free/Busy information is represented with the "FREEBUSY" property.
   This property provides a terse representation of time periods. One or
   more "FREEBUSY" properties can be specified in the "VFREEBUSY"
   calendar component.

</p>
<p>
   When present in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component, the "DTSTART" and
   "DURATION" properties SHOULD be specified prior to any "FREEBUSY"
   properties. In a free time request, these properties can be used in
   combination with the "DURATION" property to represent a request for a
   duration of free time within a specified window of time.

</p>
<p>
   Example: The following is an example of a "VFREEBUSY" calendar
   component used to request free or busy time information:

</p><pre>     BEGIN:VFREEBUSY
     ORGANIZER:MAILTO:jane_doe@host1.com
     ATTENDEE:MAILTO:john_public@host2.com

     DURATION:PT24H
     DTSTAMP:19970901T083000Z
     END:VFREEBUSY
</pre>

<p>
   The following is an example of a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component used
   to reply to the request with busy time information:

</p><pre>     BEGIN:VFREEBUSY
     ORGANIZER:MAILTO:jane_doe@host1.com
     ATTENDEE:MAILTO:john_public@host2.com

<p>
   Description: A "VALARM" calendar component is a grouping of component
   properties that is a reminder or alarm for an event. For
   example, it may be used to define a reminder for a pending event.

</p>
<p>
   The "VALARM" calendar component MUST include the "ACTION" and
   "TRIGGER" properties. The "ACTION" property further constrains the
   "VALARM" calendar component in the following ways:

</p>
<p>
   When the action is "AUDIO", the alarm can also include one and only
   one "ATTACH" property, which MUST point to a sound resource, which is
   rendered when the alarm is triggered.

</p>
<p>
   When the action is "DISPLAY", the alarm MUST also include a
   "DESCRIPTION" property, which contains the text to be displayed when
   the alarm is triggered.

</p>
<p>
   When the action is "EMAIL", the alarm MUST include a "DESCRIPTION"
   property, which contains the text to be used as the message body, a
   "SUMMARY" property, which contains the text to be used as the message
   subject, and one or more "ATTENDEE" properties, which contain the
   email address of attendees to receive the message. It can also
   include one or more "ATTACH" properties, which are intended to be
   sent as message attachments. When the alarm is triggered, the email
   message is sent.

</p>
<p>
   When the action is "PROCEDURE", the alarm MUST include one and only
   one "ATTACH" property, which MUST point to a procedure resource,
   which is invoked when the alarm is triggered.

</p>
<p>
   The "VALARM" calendar component MUST only appear within either a
   "VEVENT" calendar component. "VALARM" calendar components
   cannot be nested. Multiple mutually independent "VALARM" calendar
   components can be specified for a single "VEVENT" calendar
   component.

</p>
<p>
   The "TRIGGER" property specifies when the alarm will be triggered.
   The "TRIGGER" property specifies a duration prior to the start of an
   event. The "TRIGGER" edge may be explicitly set to be
   relative to the "START" or "END" of the event with the
   "RELATED" parameter of the "TRIGGER" property. The "TRIGGER" property
   value type can alternatively be set to an absolute calendar date and
   time of day value.

</p>
<p>
   In an alarm set to trigger on the "START" of an event, the
   "DTSTART" property MUST be present in the associated event.
   In an alarm in a "VEVENT" calendar component set to trigger on the
   "END" of the event, the "DTSTART" and "DURATION" properties MUST be present.

</p>
<p>
   The alarm can be defined such that it triggers repeatedly. A
   definition of an alarm with a repeating trigger MUST include both the
   "DURATION" and "REPEAT" properties. The "DURATION" property specifies
   the delay period, after which the alarm will repeat. The "REPEAT"
   property specifies the number of additional repetitions that the
   alarm will triggered. This repitition count is in addition to the
   initial triggering of the alarm. Both of these properties MUST be
   present in order to specify a repeating alarm. If one of these two
   properties is absent, then the alarm will not repeat beyond the
   initial trigger.

</p>
<p>
   The "ACTION" property is used within the "VALARM" calendar component
   to specify the type of action invoked when the alarm is triggered.
   The "VALARM" properties provide enough information for a specific
   action to be invoked. It is typically the responsibility of a
   "Calendar User Agent" (CUA) to deliver the alarm in the specified
   fashion. An "ACTION" property value of AUDIO specifies an alarm that
   causes a sound to be played to alert the user; DISPLAY specifies an
   alarm that causes a text message to be displayed to the user; EMAIL
   specifies an alarm that causes an electronic email message to be
   delivered to one or more email addresses; and PROCEDURE specifies an
   alarm that causes a procedure to be executed. The "ACTION" property
   MUST specify one and only one of these values.

</p>
<p>
   In an AUDIO alarm, if the optional "ATTACH" property is included, it
   MUST specify an audio sound resource. The intention is that the sound
   will be played as the alarm effect. If an "ATTACH" property is
   specified that does not refer to a sound resource, or if the
   specified sound resource cannot be rendered (because its format is
   unsupported, or because it cannot be retrieved), then the CUA or
   other entity responsible for playing the sound may choose a fallback
   action, such as playing a built-in default sound, or playing no sound
   at all.

</p>
<p>
   In a DISPLAY alarm, the intended alarm effect is for the text value
   of the "DESCRIPTION" property to be displayed to the user.

</p>
<p>
   In an EMAIL alarm, the intended alarm effect is for an email message
   to be composed and delivered to all the addresses specified by the
   "ATTENDEE" properties in the "VALARM" calendar component. The
   "DESCRIPTION" property of the "VALARM" calendar component MUST be
   used as the body text of the message, and the "SUMMARY" property MUST
   be used as the subject text. Any "ATTACH" properties in the "VALARM"
   calendar component SHOULD be sent as attachments to the message.

</p>
<p>
   In a PROCEDURE alarm, the "ATTACH" property in the "VALARM" calendar
   component MUST specify a procedure or program that is intended to be
   invoked as the alarm effect. If the procedure or program is in a
   format that cannot be rendered, then no procedure alarm will be
   invoked. If the "DESCRIPTION" property is present, its value
   specifies the argument string to be passed to the procedure or
   program. "Calendar User Agents" that receive an iCalendar object with
   this category of alarm, can disable or allow the "Calendar User" to
   disable, or otherwise ignore this type of alarm. While a very useful
   alarm capability, the PROCEDURE type of alarm SHOULD be treated by
   the "Calendar User Agent" as a potential security risk.

</p>
<p>
   Example: The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component
   that specifies an audio alarm that will sound at a precise time.

</p><pre>     BEGIN:VALARM
     TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:19970317T133000Z
     REPEAT:4
     DURATION:PT15M
     ACTION:AUDIO
     ATTACH;FMTTYPE=audio/basic:ftp://host.com/pub/sounds/bell-01.aud
     END:VALARM
</pre>

<p>
   The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component that
   specifies a display alarm that will trigger 30 minutes before the
   scheduled start of the event of its associated component.

</p><pre>     BEGIN:VALARM
     TRIGGER:-PT30M
     REPEAT:2
     DURATION:PT15M
     ACTION:DISPLAY
     DESCRIPTION:Breakfast meeting with executive\n
      team at 8:30 AM EST.
     END:VALARM
</pre>

<p>
   The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component that
   specifies an email alarm that will trigger 2 days before the
   scheduled due date/time of its associated component.
   The email has a subject, body and attachment link.

</p><pre>     BEGIN:VALARM
     TRIGGER:-P2D
     ACTION:EMAIL
     ATTENDEE:MAILTO:john_doe@host.com
     SUMMARY:*** REMINDER: SEND AGENDA FOR WEEKLY STAFF MEETING ***
     DESCRIPTION:A draft agenda needs to be sent out to the attendees
       to the weekly managers meeting (MGR-LIST). Attached is a
       pointer the document template for the agenda file.
     ATTACH;FMTTYPE=application/binary:http://host.com/templates/agen
      da.doc
     END:VALARM
</pre>

<p>
   The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component that
   specifies a procedural alarm that will trigger at a precise date/time
   The alarm will invoke a procedure file.

</p><pre>     BEGIN:VALARM
     TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:19980101T050000Z
     ACTION:PROCEDURE
     REPEAT:23

<a name="rfc.section.4.7"></a><h4><a name="anchor67">4.7</a>&nbsp;Calendar Properties</h4>

<p>
   The Calendar Properties are attributes that apply to the iCalendar
   object, as a whole. These properties do not appear within a calendar
   component. They SHOULD be specified after the "BEGIN:VCALENDAR"
   property and prior to any calendar component.

<a name="rfc.section.4.7.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor68">4.7.1</a>&nbsp;Calendar Scale</h4>

<p>
   Property Name: CALSCALE

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This property defines the calendar scale used for the
   calendar information specified in the iCalendar object.

</p>
<p>
   Value Type: TEXT

</p>
<p>
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

</p>
<p>
   Conformance: Property can be specified in an iCalendar object. The
   default value is "GREGORIAN".

</p>
<p>
   Description: This memo is based on the Gregorian calendar scale. The
   Gregorian calendar scale is assumed if this property is not specified
   in the iCalendar object. It is expected that other calendar scales
   will be defined in other specifications or by future versions of this
   memo.

</p>
<p>
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

</p><pre>     calscale   = "CALSCALE" calparam ":" calvalue CRLF

     calparam   = *(";" xparam)

     calvalue   = "GREGORIAN" / iana-token

<a name="rfc.section.4.7.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor69">4.7.2</a>&nbsp;Method</h4>

<p>
   Property Name: METHOD

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This property defines the iCalendar object method associated
   with the calendar object.

</p>
<p>
   Value Type: TEXT

</p>
<p>
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

</p>
<p>
   Conformance: The property can be specified in an iCalendar object.

</p>
<p>
   Description: When used in a MIME message entity, the value of this
   property MUST be the same as the Content-Type "method" parameter
   value. This property can only appear once within the iCalendar
   object. If either the "METHOD" property or the Content-Type "method"
   parameter is specified, then the other MUST also be specified.

</p>
<p>
   No methods are defined by this specification. This is the subject of
   other specifications, such as the iCalendar Transport-independent

</p>
<p>
   Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) defined by <a class="info" href="#ITIP">[3]<span> (</span><span class="info">Silverberg,

</p>
<p>
   If this property is not present in the iCalendar object, then a
   scheduling transaction MUST NOT be assumed. In such cases, the
   iCalendar object is merely being used to transport a snapshot of some
   calendar information; without the intention of conveying a scheduling
   semantic.

</p>
<p>
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

   Property Name: EXTENSIONS

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: The existance of this property notifies the recipient
   that the sender is conforming to this specification.

</p>
<p>
   Value Type: The default value type for this property is multi valued
   TEXT.

</p>
<p>
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be specified
   on this property.

</p>
<p> Conformance: The property MUST BE specified in "VCALENDAR" calendar
components that wish to conform to this specification. The
property must exist and may be empty.
</p>
<p>
   Description: The property MUST BE specified within "VCALENDAR" calendar components and may be empty.
An empty value indicates that the sender conforms to this specification
and no other extensions. The value is comma separated list of extensions that
are supported by the Organizer.

</p>
<p>
The format for specifying RFC's is to specify the letters 'RFC' in upper
case followed by the RFC number without a dash. As in 'RFC1234' and not 'RFC-1234'.
Non standard extensions MUST start with "X-" or "x-" as in "x-vendor1-extension1".
Support for IETF drafts is discouraged as they expire and are removed making
their names reusable and with a possible different meaning at a later time.

<a name="rfc.section.4.8.2.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor78">4.8.2.3</a>&nbsp;Classification</h4>

<p>
   Property Name: CLASS

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This property defines the access classification for a
   calendar component.

</p>
<p>
   Value Type: TEXT

</p>
<p>
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

</p>
<p>
   Conformance: The property can be specified once in a "VEVENT"
   calendar components.

</p>
<p>
   Description: An access classification is only one component of the
   general security system within a calendar application. It provides a
   method of capturing the scope of the access the calendar owner
   intends for information within an individual calendar entry. The
   access classification of an individual iCalendar component is useful
   when measured along with the other security components of a calendar
   system (e.g., calendar user authentication, authorization, access
   rights, access role, etc.). Hence, the semantics of the individual
   access classifications cannot be completely defined by this memo
   alone. Additionally, due to the "blind" nature of most exchange
   processes using this memo, these access classifications cannot serve
   as an enforcement statement for a system receiving an iCalendar
   object. Rather, they provide a method for capturing the intention of
   the calendar owner for the access to the calendar component.

</p>
<p>
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

</p><pre>     class      = "CLASS" classparam ":" classvalue CRLF

<p>
   Conformance: The property can be specified in "VEVENT",
   "VFREEBUSY" or "VALARM" calendar components.

</p>
<p>
   Description: In a "VEVENT" calendar component the property may be
   used to specify a duration of the event, instead of an explicit end
   date/time. In a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component the property may be
   used to specify the interval of free time being requested.

</p>
<p>
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

   Property Parameter: "FBTYPE" and non-standard parameters can be
   specified on this property.

</p>
<p>
   Description: These time periods can be specified as either a start
   and end date-time or a start date-time and duration. The date and
   time MUST be a UTC time format.

</p>
<p>
   "FREEBUSY" properties within the "VFREEBUSY" calendar component
   SHOULD be sorted in ascending order, based on start time and then end
   time, with the earliest periods first.

</p>
<p>
   The "FREEBUSY" property can specify more than one value, separated by
   the COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44). In such cases, the
   "FREEBUSY" property values SHOULD all be of the same "FBTYPE"
   property parameter type (e.g., all values of a particular "FBTYPE"
   listed together in a single property).

   Description: Time Transparency is the characteristic of an event that
   determines whether it appears to consume time on a calendar. Events
   that consume actual time for the individual or resource associated

</p>
<p>
   with the calendar SHOULD be recorded as OPAQUE, allowing them to be
   detected by free-busy time searches. Other events, which do not take
   up the individual's (or resource's) time SHOULD be recorded as
   TRANSPARENT, making them invisible to free-busy time searches.

</p>

<p>
   Value Type: CAL-ADDRESS

</p>
<p>
   Property Parameters: Non-standard, language, calendar user type,
   group or list membership, participation role, participation status,
   RSVP expectation, delegatee, delegator, sent by, common name or
   directory entry reference property parameters can be specified on
   this property.

</p>
<p>
   Conformance: This property MUST be specified in an iCalendar object
   that specifies a group scheduled calendar entity. This property MUST
   NOT be specified in an iCalendar object when publishing the calendar
   information (e.g., NOT in an iCalendar object that specifies the
   publication of a calendar user's busy time, event).
   This property is not specified in an iCalendar object that defines
   calendar entities that are not group scheduled entities, but are
   entities only on a single user's calendar.

</p>
<p>
   Description: The property MUST only be specified within calendar
   components to specify participants, non-participants and the chair of
   a group scheduled calendar entity. The property is specified within
   an "EMAIL" category of the "VALARM" calendar component to specify an
   email address that is to receive the email type of iCalendar alarm.

</p>
<p>
   The property parameter CN is for the common or displayable name
   associated with the calendar address; ROLE, for the intended role
   that the attendee will have in the calendar component; PARTSTAT, for
   the status of the attendee's participation; RSVP, for indicating
   whether the favor of a reply is requested; CUTYPE, to indicate the
   type of calendar user; MEMBER, to indicate the groups that the

   that the original request was delegated to; and DELEGATED-FROM, to
   indicate whom the request was delegated from; SENT-BY, to indicate
   whom is acting on behalf of the ATTENDEE; and DIR, to indicate the
   URI that points to the directory information corresponding to the
   attendee. These property parameters can be specified on an "ATTENDEE"
   property a "VEVENT" calendar component.
  They MUST not be specified in an "ATTENDEE" property in a
   "VFREEBUSY" or "VALARM" calendar component. If the LANGUAGE property
   parameter is specified, the identified language applies to the CN
   parameter.

</p>
<p>
   A recipient delegated a request MUST inherit the RSVP and ROLE values
   from the attendee that delegated the request to them.

</p>
<p>
   Multiple attendees can be specified by including multiple "ATTENDEE"
   properties within the calendar component.

</p>
<p>
   Value Type: URI

</p>
<p>
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

</p>
<p>
   Conformance: This property can be specified once in the "VEVENT" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

</p>
<p>
   Description: This property may be used in a calendar component to

<p>
   Property Name: UID

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This property defines the persistent, globally unique
   identifier for the calendar component.

</p>
<p>
   Value Type: TEXT

</p>
<p>
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

</p>
<p>
   Conformance: The property MUST be specified in the "VEVENT" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

</p>
<p>
   Description: The UID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier. The
   generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier is
   unique. There are several algorithms that can be used to accomplish
   this. The identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical syntax to the
   <a class="info" href="#_XREF_RFC.822">[6]<span> (</span><span class="info">Crocker, D., “Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages,�? August&nbsp;1982.</span><span>)</span></a> addr-spec. A good method to assure uniqueness is to put the
   domain name or a domain literal IP address of the host on which the
   identifier was created on the right hand side of the "@", and on the
   left hand side, put a combination of the current calendar date and
   time of day (i.e., formatted in as a DATE-TIME value) along with some
   other currently unique (perhaps sequential) identifier available on
   the system (for example, a process id number). Using a date/time
   value on the left hand side and a domain name or domain literal on

</p>
<p>
   the right hand side makes it possible to guarantee uniqueness since
   no two hosts should be using the same domain name or IP address at
   the same time. Though other algorithms will work, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the right hand side contain some domain identifier (either of
   the host itself or otherwise) such that the generator of the message
   identifier can guarantee the uniqueness of the left hand side within
   the scope of that domain.

</p>
<p>
   This is the method for correlating scheduling messages with the
   referenced "VEVENT" calendar component.

</p>
<p>
   This property is an important method for group scheduling
   applications to match requests with later replies, modifications or
   deletion requests. Calendaring and scheduling applications MUST
   generate this property in "VEVENT" calendar
   components to assure interoperability with other group scheduling
   applications. This identifier is created by the calendar system that
   generates an iCalendar object.

</p>
<p>
   Implementations MUST be able to receive and persist values of at
   least 255 characters for this property.

</p>
<p>
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

In iCal-Basic there are no recurrence rules.
To add instances, just re-issue the component.
When all of the instances can not be described in
a single "VEVENT" calendar component, then use the "METHOD"
property with a value of "ADD" to signify that you are adding
ZZone or more instances to an existing UID.

<p>
   Property Name: RDATE

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This property defines the list of additional date/times for a
   recurrence set.

</p>
<p>
   Value Type: The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
   The value type can be set to DATE or PERIOD.

</p>
<p>
   Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type and time zone
   identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.

</p>
<p>
   Conformance: The property can be specified in "VEVENT" calendar component.

</p>
<p>
   Description: This property can appear
   to define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences. 

</p>
<p> The recurrence dates, if specified, are used in computing the
recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of recurrence
instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is generated by
considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with the "RDATE"
properties contained within the iCalendar object. The "DTSTART"
property defines the first instance in the recurrence set. Where
duplicate instances are generated by the "RDATE" properties, only one
recurrence is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored. The value
MUST BE in UTC or have no time zone identifier (localtime).
</p>
<p>
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

</p><pre>     rdate      = "RDATE" rdtparam ":" rdtval *("," rdtval) CRLF

<a name="rfc.section.4.11.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor116">4.11.2</a>&nbsp;Repeat Count</h4>

<p>
   Property Name: REPEAT

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This property defines the number of time the alarm should be
   repeated, after the initial trigger.

</p>
<p>
   Value Type: INTEGER

</p>
<p>
   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

</p>
<p>
   Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VALARM" calendar

<a name="rfc.section.4.11.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor117">4.11.3</a>&nbsp;Trigger</h4>

<p>
   Property Name: TRIGGER

</p>
<p>
   Purpose: This property specifies when an alarm will trigger.

</p>
<p>
   Value Type: The default value type is DURATION. The value type can be
   set to a DATE-TIME value type, in which case the value MUST specify a
   UTC formatted DATE-TIME value.

</p>
<p>
   Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type, 
   or trigger relationship property parameters can be
   specified on this property. The trigger relationship property
   parameter MUST only be specified when the value type is DURATION.

</p>
<p>
   Conformance: This property MUST be specified in the "VALARM" calendar
   component.

</p>
<p>
   Description: Within the "VALARM" calendar component, this property
   defines when the alarm will trigger. The default value type is
   DURATION, specifying a relative time for the trigger of the alarm.
   The default duration is relative to the start of an event
   that the alarm is associated with. The duration can be explicitly set

</p>
<p>
   to trigger from either the end or the start of the associated event
   with the "RELATED" parameter. A value of START will set the
   alarm to trigger off the start of the associated event. A
   value of END will set the alarm to trigger off the end of the
   associated event.

</p>
<p>
   Either a positive or negative duration may be specified for the
   "TRIGGER" property. An alarm with a positive duration is triggered
   after the associated start or end of the event. An alarm
   with a negative duration is triggered before the associated start or
   end of the event.

</p>
<p>
   The "RELATED" property parameter is not valid if the value type of
   the property is set to DATE-TIME (i.e., for an absolute date and time
   alarm trigger). If a value type of DATE-TIME is specified, then the
   property value MUST be specified in the UTC time format.

</p>
<p>
   If the trigger is set relative to START, then the "DTSTART" property
   MUST be present in the associated "VEVENT" calendar
   component. If an alarm is specified for an event with the trigger set
   relative to the END, then the "DSTART" and
   "DURATION' properties MUST be present in the associated "VEVENT"
   calendar component.

</p>
<p>
   Alarms specified in an event which is defined in terms of a
   DATE value type will be triggered relative to 00:00:00 UTC on the
   specified date. For example, if "DTSTART:19980205Z, then the duration
   trigger will be relative to19980205T000000Z.

</p>
<p>
   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

</p><pre>     trigger    = "TRIGGER" (trigrel / trigabs)

     trigrel    = *(

   Conformance: The property can be specified in "VEVENT" calendar component.

</p>
<p>
   Description: When a calendar component is created, its sequence
   number is zero (US-ASCII decimal 48). It is monotonically incremented
   by the "Organizer's" CUA each time the "Organizer" makes a
   revision to the calendar component. Any change to a component requires
   the "SEQUENCE" property value to be incremented.

   The "Attendee" includes this property in an iCalendar object that it
   sends to the "Organizer" to specify the version of the calendar
   component that the "Attendee" is referring to.

</p>
<p>
   A change to the sequence number is not the mechanism that an
   "Organizer" uses to request a response from the "Attendees". The

   Description: The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
   provides a "standard mechanism for doing non-standard things". This
   extension support is provided for implementers to "push the envelope"
   on the existing version of the memo. Extension properties are
   specified by property and/or property parameter names that have the
   prefix text of "X-" (the two character sequence: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
   X character followed by the HYPEN-MINUS character). It is recommended
   that vendors concatenate onto this sentinel another short prefix text
   to identify the vendor. This will facilitate readability of the
   extensions and minimize possible collision of names between different
   vendors. User agents that support this content type are expected to
   be able to parse the extension properties and property parameters but
   can ignore them.

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;Recommended Practices</h3>

<p>
   These recommended practices should be followed in order to assure
   consistent handling of the following cases for an iCalendar object.
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
   1.  Content lines longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded.

</p>
<p>
   2.  A calendar entry with a "DTSTART" property but no "DURATION"
       property does not take up any time. It is intended to represent
       an event that is associated with a given calendar date and time
       of day, such as an anniversary. Since the event does not take up
       any time, it MUST NOT be used to record busy time no matter what
       the value for the "TRANSP" property.

</p>
<p>
   3.  When the multiple iCalendar object have multiple instances each
       having the same start date/time, they should be collapsed to,
       and considered as, a single instance when every other property
       and parameter value are also the same.
      

</p>
<p>
   4.  When a calendar user receives multiple requests for the same
       calendar component (e.g., REQUEST for a "VEVENT" calendar
       component) as a result of being on multiple mailing lists
       specified by "ATTENDEE" properties in the request, they SHOULD
       respond to only one of the requests. The calendar user SHOULD
       also specify (using the "MEMBER" parameter of the "ATTENDEE"
       property) which mailing list they are a member of.

</p>
<p>
   5.  An implementation can truncate a "SUMMARY" property value to 255
       characters.

</p>
<p>
   6.  If seconds of the minute are not supported by an implementation,
       then a value of "00" SHOULD be specified for the seconds
       component in a time value.

</p>
<p>
   7.  If the value type parameter (VALUE=) contains an unknown value
       type, it SHOULD be treated as TEXT.

</p>
<p>
   8.  Some possible English values for CATEGORIES property include
        "ANNIVERSARY", "APPOINTMENT", "BUSINESS", "EDUCATION",
        "HOLIDAY", "MEETING", "MISCELLANEOUS", "NON-WORKING HOURS", "NOT
        IN OFFICE", "PERSONAL", "PHONE CALL", "SICK DAY", "SPECIAL
        OCCASION", "TRAVEL", "VACATION". Categories can be specified in
        any registered language.

</p>
<p>
   9.  Some possible English values for RESOURCES property include
        "CATERING", "CHAIRS", "COMPUTER PROJECTOR", "EASEL", "OVERHEAD
        PROJECTOR", "SPEAKER PHONE", "TABLE", "TV", "VCR", "VIDEO
        PHONE", "VEHICLE". Resources can be specified in any registered
        language.

</p>
<p>
   10.  When comparing objects to determine which is the newest:
        They must have the same "UID" property value.
        If the "UID" properties values are the same then the
        one with the larger "SEQUENCE" value is the newest.
        If the "UID" and "SEQUENCE" property values are the same
        then the one with the newer "DTSTAMP" property value is 
        the newest. If all three are the same, then the objects
        are considered to be of the same age.

<a name="rfc.section.7"></a><h3>7.&nbsp;Registration of Content Type Elements</h3>

<p>
   This section provides the process for registration of MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type iCalendar object methods and
   new or modified properties.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor129">7.1</a>&nbsp;Registration of New and Modified iCalendar Object Methods</h4>

<p>
   New MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type iCalendar object
   methods are registered by the publication of an IETF Request for
   Comments (RFC). Changes to an iCalendar object method are registered
   by the publication of a revision of the RFC defining the method.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor130">7.2</a>&nbsp;Registration of New Properties</h4>

<p>
   This section defines procedures by which new properties or enumerated
   property values for the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
   can be registered with the IANA. Non-IANA properties can be used by
   bilateral agreement, provided the associated properties names follow
   the "X-" convention.

</p>
<p>
   The procedures defined here are designed to allow public comment and
   review of new properties, while posing only a small impediment to the
   definition of new properties.

</p>
<p>
   Registration of a new property is accomplished by the following
   steps.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.2.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor131">7.2.1</a>&nbsp;Define the property</h4>

<p>
   A property is defined by completing the following template.
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
     To: ietf-calendar@imc.org

</p>
<p>
     Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME property XXX

</p>
<p>
     Property name:

</p>
<p>
     Property purpose:

</p>
<p>
     Property value type(s):

</p>
<p>
     Property parameter (s):

</p>
<p>
     Conformance:

</p>
<p>
     Description:

</p>
<p>
     Format definition:

</p>
<p>
     Examples:

</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>
   The meaning of each field in the template is as follows.

</p>
<p>
   Property name: The name of the property, as it will appear in the
   body of an text/calendar MIME Content-Type "property: value" line to
   the left of the colon ":".

</p>
<p>
   Property purpose: The purpose of the property (e.g., to indicate a
   delegate for the event, etc.). Give a short but clear
   description.

</p>
<p>
   Property value type (s): Any of the valid value types for the
   property value needs to be specified. The default value type also
   needs to be specified. If a new value type is specified, it needs to
   be declared in this section.

</p>
<p>
   Property parameter (s): Any of the valid property parameters for the
   property needs to be specified.

</p>
<p>
   Conformance: The calendar components that the property can appear in
   needs to be specified.

</p>
<p>
   Description: Any special notes about the property, how it is to be
   used, etc.

</p>
<p>
   Format definition: The ABNF for the property definition needs to be
   specified.

</p>
<p>
   Examples: One or more examples of instances of the property needs to
   be specified.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.2.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor132">7.2.2</a>&nbsp;Post the Property definition</h4>

<p>
   The property description MUST be posted to the new property
   discussion list, ietf-calendar@imc.org.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.2.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor133">7.2.3</a>&nbsp;Allow a comment period</h4>

<p>
   Discussion on the new property MUST be allowed to take place on the
   list for a minimum of two weeks. Consensus MUST be reached on the
   property before proceeding to the next step.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.2.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor134">7.2.4</a>&nbsp;Submit the property for approval</h4>

<p>
   Once the two-week comment period has elapsed, and the proposer is
   convinced consensus has been reached on the property, the
   registration application should be submitted to the Method Reviewer
   for approval. The Method Reviewer is appointed to the Application
   Area Directors and can either accept or reject the property
   registration. An accepted registration should be passed on by the
   Method Reviewer to the IANA for inclusion in the official IANA method
   registry. The registration can be rejected for any of the following
   reasons. 1) Insufficient comment period; 2) Consensus not reached; 3)
   Technical deficiencies raised on the list or elsewhere have not been
   addressed. The Method Reviewer's decision to reject a property can be
   appealed by the proposer to the IESG, or the objections raised can be
   addressed by the proposer and the property resubmitted.

</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor135">7.3</a>&nbsp;Property Change Control</h4>

<p>
   Existing properties can be changed using the same process by which
   they were registered.
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
        1.           Define the change

</p>
<p>
        2.           Post the change

</p>
<p>
        3.           Allow a comment period

</p>
<p>
        4.           Submit the property for approval

</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p>
<p>
   Note that the original author or any other interested party can
   propose a change to an existing property, but that such changes
   should only be proposed when there are serious omissions or errors in
   the published memo. The Method Reviewer can object to a change if it
   is not backward compatible, but is not required to do so.

</p>
<p>
   Property definitions can never be deleted from the IANA registry, but
   properties which are no longer believed to be useful can be declared
   OBSOLETE by a change to their "intended use" field.
